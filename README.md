# Basin
A specification and libraries to stream updates to an object using JSONPaths.
We use the term "basin" because streams flow into a basin.

See in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-basin).

See in [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ObjectBasin).

This library supports various ways to update objects or their contents:
* appending to the end of a string
* inserting anywhere in a string
* removing characters from a string
* appending to the end of a list
* inserting anywhere in a list
* overwriting an item in a list
* deleting items in a list
* setting a value in an object
* tracking different cursors for different streams
